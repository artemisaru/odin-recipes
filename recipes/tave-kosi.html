  <h1>Baked Lamb with Rice<em>(Tave Kosi)</em></h1>
  <img src="../images/tave-kosi.jpg" alt="Tave Kosi">
  
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This dish is old. It was first recorded in 1452 when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II was occupying Elsaban - a city in central Albania.</p>
  <p>Whilst there, he was served a dish which consisted of lamb marinated in yoghurt. The cooks of this dish would then use the leftover marinated yoghurt to top other casseroles, which first became known as 'the casserole of Elbasan' and then the famous Tave Kosi.</p>
