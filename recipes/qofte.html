  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Albanian Mint Meatballs with ground beef (or qofte) are a version of kofta. Koftas are known throughout Mediterranean, the Balkans, Middle East etc.</p>
  <p>They are usually made with ground beef, however there are versions with lamb, chicken, vegetables etc. The most common method of cooking the meatballs is to fry them. Albanian meatballs are one of the most versatile dishes you can make. Typically they are served with a big salad, a yogurt based dip, bread etc. However, you can also serve these mint meatballs with spaghetti, either on their own or in a tomato based sauce.</p>
